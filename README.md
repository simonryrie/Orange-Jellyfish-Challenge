# Orange-Jellyfish-Challenge

Scenario:
You are a software developer for an e-commerce site. Currently a new web application is being built
which will allow customers to complete their shopping online.
The business has provided a rough mockup and asked you to deliver the following frontend
functionality:
"We need to display our products on a page for customers to view. They should be able to add and
remove these products from their shopping basket.
The backend team have just completed work on a 'getProducts' API which will return product
information from the database."

Task:
Using a tool of your choice (Trello, GitHub Issues etc.) break the above business requirement down into
a series of tasks for the development team to work through.
Things to consider:
• Is there any further information that you as a developer require from the business before
starting the development work?
• Think about potential errors that could occur when this new functionality is running in
production, how would you handle/mitigate these?

No coding is required as part of this challenge!
